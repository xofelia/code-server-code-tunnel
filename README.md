# VS Code Server

The aim of this project is to be able to install the following on a remote machine quickly in a docker container:
- VS Code Tunnel
- Docker

[VSCode tunnel](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/tunnels) is used to be able to connect to a docker container as a development server without interfering with the host machine.

Docker is installed to enable the installation of [VS Code Dev Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers)

Think of it as a development environment host in a box
